                Since Persephone's father was Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder as well as the ruler of the other gods, and her mother was Demeter, the goddess of harvest and fertility,
            it was largely unexpected when she would eventually become the queen of the underworld. Growing up, she was known to be lovely spirited, and so many gods were drawn to her.
            As a means of protection, Demeter guarded Persephone from the other men.

                One day, when Persephone was gathering flowers, Hades, the god of the Underworld, captured her as his bride. Rather than speaking to her to form a genuine connection, he had
            only consulted with Zeus who then gave him permission to have her. He was one of many gods that had been interested in Persephone, and thus, he wanted to be with her despite her 
            having no choice in the matter. 
            
                When Demeter discovered that she had been kidnapped, she became miserable and began completely neglecting the growth of plants. Instead, she carried torches and searched the world. Upon noticing 
            Demeter's and dispair and the mass famine as a result of zero harvests, Zeus commanded Hades that he release Persephone. Unfortunately, while in the underworld, Persephone had eaten a single pomegranate 
            seed, meaning she could not be entirely freed. Instead, she had to now stay in the underworld for one-third of every year, and could spend the remaining two-thirds of every year with her mother.

                Whenever Persephone would return to earth for the spring and summer, the harvests would suddenly flourish and the meadows would bloom beautifully, explaining how Persephone is known to be
            the goddess of spring. Here, she would be cared for by her mother. Upon autumn, Persephone would have to go back to the underworld with Hades, leaving the harvests to die down and no longer grow.
            During these months, the earth would look noticable duller and barren. Ultimately, in Greek Mythology, Persephone's story describes the reason we have the four seasons each year.
